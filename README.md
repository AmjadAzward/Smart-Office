#  Smart Office Electronics

A project simulating a **Smart Office System** using **Logic Gates** built in **Tinkercad**. This project automates office electronics (like lighting, fan control, and security alerts) through hardware logic—no programming required.

---

## ⚙️ Project Overview

This system leverages **basic logic gates** (AND, OR, NOT, XOR, NAND, NOR) to implement conditional behavior in a smart office environment. Simulated entirely in **Tinkercad**, it demonstrates how digital logic design can control real-world devices.

## 🔍 Features

- 💡 Automatic lighting based on specific conditions
- 🌬️ Fan activation using logical inputs
- 🔒 Security and alert simulation using gate combinations
- ⚠️ Emergency handling circuits
- 📊 Truth-table driven decision flow

---

## 🧪 Simulation Platform

🔗 **Tinkercad Circuits** by Autodesk  
All simulations were designed and tested using [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/), a free and user-friendly web-based electronics simulator.
