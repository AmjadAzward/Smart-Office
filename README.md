#  Smart Office Electronics

A project simulating a **Smart Office System** using **Logic Gates** built in **Tinkercad**. This project automates office electronics (like lighting, fan control, and security alerts) through hardware logic—no programming required.

##  Project Overview

This system leverages **basic logic gates** (AND, OR, NOT, XOR, NAND, NOR) to implement conditional behavior in a smart office environment. Simulated entirely in **Tinkercad**, it demonstrates how digital logic design can control real-world devices.

---

##  Features

-  Automatic lighting based on specific conditions
-  Fan activation using logical inputs
-  Security and alert simulation using gate combinations
-  Emergency handling circuits
-  Truth-table driven decision flow

---

##  Simulation Platform

 **Tinkercad Circuits** by Autodesk  
All simulations were designed and tested using [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/), a free and user-friendly web-based electronics simulator.

##  Circuit Diagrams & Truth Tables

 Please **refer to the attached slide presentation** for:
- Logic gate circuit diagrams
- Truth tables for all systems
- Descriptions of each input/output scenario

##  Setup Instructions

1.  Create a free account on [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/).
2.  Search for the public project **“Smart Office Electronics”** (or import from the shared link, if provided).
3.  Run the simulation and test logic with virtual inputs (switches) and outputs (LEDs, buzzers, etc.).
4.  Use the truth tables to verify correct circuit behavior.
